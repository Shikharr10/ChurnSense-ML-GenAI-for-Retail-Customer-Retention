# ChurnSense-ML-GenAI-for-Retail-Customer-Retention
This project helps an online store figure out which customers might stop shopping with them. It uses basic computer methods to make these predictions and then uses smart language tools to explain in easy words why a customer might leave. This way, the store can understand and take action to keep customers happy.
